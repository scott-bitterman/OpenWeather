        Latitude and longitude are a pair of numbers (coordinates) 
        used to describe a position on the plane 
        of a geographic coordinate system. The numbers are 
        in decimal degrees format and range from -90 to 90 for latitude 
        and -180 to 180 for longitude.

        Don't bother calling the OpenWeather API, if the values passed in 
        are known to fail.
